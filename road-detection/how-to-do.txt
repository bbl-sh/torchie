Got it! You're essentially building a two-part system:

1. **Distributed Training Setup:**
   - A lightweight framework for enabling your friends' computers to connect to your system over the internet using tunneling, SSH, and GPU sharing for PyTorch distributed training.
   - The focus is on easily connecting machines and running distributed PyTorch jobs without needing full-fledged cloud infrastructure.

2. **Secondary Project - Kubernetes and Docker Instances:**
   - Using Kubernetes and Docker for containerized EC2-like instance management, unrelated to the PyTorch setup.

Letâ€™s break this down step-by-step.

---

## **1. Distributed Training Setup (Primary Project)**

### Core Objectives:
- **Tunneling & SSH Setup:**
  - Allow your friends' machines to securely connect to a central controller node over the internet.
  - Enable PyTorch distributed training using their GPUs via SSH and a networked setup.

- **Minimal Overhead:**
  - Lightweight and easy-to-deploy system for your friends.

---

### Tools and Technologies for Distributed Training:
1. **Tunneling:**
   - Use **ngrok** or **WireGuard** to establish a secure tunnel.
     - **ngrok:** Quickly exposes local systems to the internet with a public endpoint.
     - **WireGuard:** Sets up a private VPN-like environment for secure connections.
   - Alternatively, **SSH port forwarding** (`ssh -R`) can also expose ports securely.

2. **Node Communication:**
   - Use **OpenSSH** to enable SSH access to your friends' systems.
   - Scripts to automate public/private key exchange to simplify secure connections.

3. **Distributed Training Framework:**
   - **PyTorch Distributed Package:**
     - Use `torch.distributed` for scaling your training across nodes.
     - Define `MASTER_ADDR` and `MASTER_PORT` (via your central system).
   - **TorchElastic:** Fault-tolerant distributed training for dynamic environments.
   - **NCCL (NVIDIA Collective Communications Library):** Optimized backend for GPU communication.

4. **Resource Allocation:**
   - Use `nvidia-docker` and `nvidia-container-toolkit` to run PyTorch jobs on GPUs.

---

### Implementation Plan:
1. **Central Controller Node:**
   - Host a central node that coordinates jobs and manages SSH connections.
   - Use tools like `paramiko` or `fabric` in Python to automate SSH-based task execution.

2. **Setup Tunnels:**
   - Distribute scripts to your friends to establish tunnels:
     ```bash
     ssh -R 12345:localhost:22 your_username@central_controller_ip
     ```
     - Replace with `ngrok` for ease of setup:
       ```bash
       ngrok tcp 22
       ```

3. **PyTorch Distributed Launch Script:**
   - Use a `torchrun`-based script to launch jobs:
     ```bash
     torchrun --nproc_per_node=1 --nnodes=3 --node_rank=0 \
         --master_addr="central_controller_ip" --master_port=12345 script.py
     ```

4. **Automation:**
   - Write a Python or Bash script for:
     - Starting SSH connections.
     - Checking GPU availability on remote nodes (`nvidia-smi`).
     - Launching PyTorch jobs.

5. **Optional Monitoring:**
   - Add monitoring tools like **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for real-time GPU usage visualization.

## **2. EC2-like Instance Management (Secondary Project)**

### Core Objectives:
- Build EC2-like containerized instances using Docker and Kubernetes.
- Enable easy provisioning, scaling, and management.

---

### Tools and Technologies for Kubernetes + Docker:
1. **Kubernetes (K8s):**
   - Use Kubernetes for orchestration and instance lifecycle management.
   - Deploy using **kubeadm** or a managed service (e.g., K3s for lightweight clusters).

2. **Docker:**
   - Use Docker containers for packaging and running instances.

3. **Networking:**
   - Use **Flannel** or **Calico** as a CNI plugin for networking.
   - Use Kubernetes **LoadBalancer** or **Ingress** for service exposure.

4. **Instance Setup:**
   - Use Kubernetes' `Deployment` or `StatefulSet` to define container-based instances.
   - Configure resources (CPU, memory, GPU) via Kubernetes' resource requests/limits.

---

### Implementation Plan:
1. **Deploy Kubernetes Cluster:**
   - Install Kubernetes locally or on cloud VMs.
   - Use Helm charts to simplify the deployment of supporting services.

2. **Create Custom Docker Images:**
   - Create Docker images with the necessary tools and environments (Python, PyTorch, etc.).

3. **Instance Lifecycle Management:**
   - Use Kubernetes API or `kubectl` to:
     - Start/stop instances (`kubectl scale`).
     - Monitor resources (`kubectl top`).

4. **Optional Enhancements:**
   - Use **KubeVirt** to add VM support if you want to run VMs instead of containers.
   - Integrate CI/CD pipelines with **ArgoCD** or **Jenkins**.

---

## **Final Steps**

- **Primary Project (Distributed Training):**
  - Write a Python script that:
    - Automates tunneling setup (via ngrok or SSH).
    - Checks GPU availability on remote nodes.
    - Launches distributed PyTorch training jobs.
  - Test the script on multiple friends' machines.

- **Secondary Project (Kubernetes Instances):**
  - Deploy a Kubernetes cluster.
  - Create and manage containerized instances using Kubernetes deployments.
